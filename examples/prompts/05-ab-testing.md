## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Test One Variable

```
# Good - Test only subject line
"A/B test subjects: 'Save 20%' vs 'Get 20% Off' with same template"

"A/B test: Subject A + Template A vs Subject B + Template B"
```

Why: You won't know which change caused the difference

### ‚úÖ Adequate Sample Size

```
# Minimum 1,000 contacts per test
"Test requires at least 2,000 total contacts (1,000 per variant)"
```

### ‚úÖ Statistical Significance

```
"Run test for at least 4-8 hours to get reliable results"
```

### ‚úÖ Clear Hypothesis

```
"Test hypothesis: Personalized subject lines will increase opens by 10%+"
```

## Common A/B Test Scenarios

### Welcome Email Optimization

```
"A/B test welcome email:
A: Immediate welcome template welcome_formal

```
